#Final Project - Ranking System for EPL

## Description

The EPL (England Premier League) 2019/2020 season has been suspended after March 11, 2020, Due to the spread of COVID-19. I implemented this project to predict the final ranking of EPL by constructing a PDF (probability distribution function) using previous data and predict the team's winning probability through the existed data as well.

##Usage

Please load the project on your IDE and use Java version 1.8 as the default SDK. After running the project, you should see my prediction for the game that has been suspended and the following 3 functions: 1. View the current ranking; 2. Enter a new game and adjust the ranking; 3. Make a winning prediction based on your entered expectations And probability of occurrence. The result will come up after entering function number and following the instructions.
